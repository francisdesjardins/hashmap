This is a work-in-progress (well, it is mostly complete).

Installation
----------

Using npm:

    $ npm install hashmap-jdk

Using a browser (Bower support coming soon) :

If you want to give it a try, you can download the [latest master version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/francisdesjardins/hashmap/master/dist/hashmap.js), it's usually stable. There is also a [minified version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/francisdesjardins/hashmap/master/dist/hashmap.min.js).

To run the tests:

    $ npm test

Motivation
----------

Sometimes you need more than a simple HashMap

Alternatives?
----------

If you need a simple HashMap that gets the job done, I invite you to head over [HashMap](https://github.com/flesler/hashmap) by [Ariel Flesler](https://github.com/flesler), the hashing portion of my code is inspired by his work.
